## Problem Statement

The PMFBY scheme provides financial security to farmers. We will analyse its effectiveness usingstructured data analysis. We will use SQL queries to extract key insights on premiums, claims, andfarmer demographics. The challenge is to process multi-year data efficiently, identify trends, andgenerate reports that help stakeholders assess the schemeâ€™s impact.

## Objective

This assignment will help students develop DBMS skills for managing and analysing large datasets.They will learn to manipulate data using various SQL commands, perform operations like JOINs,GROUP BY, and subqueries, and optimise database performance using advanced SQL operationsand constraints.  The focus is on deriving insights from the PMFBY dataset to assess insurancecoverage trends, claim settlements, and demographic distributions
